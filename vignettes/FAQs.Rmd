### 1. Why does an optimised scenario with a budget equal to (or less), than the Global Plan have greater impact?

The Global Plan specified broad intervention scale-up projections that were, in
most instances (not all) at the country level. As such, there is space for an
increase in efficiency, resulting in a greater impact for the same or less
spending, with optimal sub-national targeting of interventions. This is what the
optimised solutions are in the Global Fund runs.

### 2. Why does a decrease in the budget of optimised solutions occasionally result in increased impact?

There are a number of reasons why this could occur, Firstly the optimisation is
set up to minimise and equally weighted sum of cases and deaths. Therefore an
increase in one output, may be outweighed by a decrease in the other. In this 
case the aggregate weighted sum of cases and deaths will have increased with 
a smaller budget.

Secondly, One of the conditions of the budget optimisation is that treatment 
must be the last intervention for which coverage is reduced when reducing the 
available budget. This is implemented by removing any lower-coverage treatment 
options when the budget is high enough. When the budget is reduced below this 
threshold the lower-coverage treatment options become available again. For low 
incidence settings, due to model stochastic, it is possible for a run with 
lower tx coverage to have lower case numbers than a run with higher treatment 
coverage.

### 3. How do I filter outputs to select a specific scenario?

Filtering a specific scenario can be performed by selecting the relevant 
scenario options from the pre, replenishment and post scenario columns. For 
budget optimisation outputs, select the relevant pre and post scenarios and the
required budget proportion (e.g. `pre = Follow_GP`, `replenishement = 0.75` and
`post = Revert_to_GP`). For fixed scenarions, select the relevant pre,
replenishment and post scenarios (e.g. `pre = Follow_GP`, `replenishment = Revert_to_GP`
and `post = Revert_to_GP`). Please see the 
[companion output dictionary vignette](Output_dictionary.html) for more help.

### 4. Can I interpolate intervention coverage between optimised budget levels?

In most cases yes, however intervention trends over multiple budget steps may
not be linear or monotonic. As a result it is suggested to always interpolate
between single budget steps (e.g. 0.6 to 0.65), not across multiple 
(e.g. 0.6 to 0.8). Optimised output is provided with steps of 0.05 to 
facilitate this.

### 5. Why do some countries not have the full compliment of budget levels?

In a number of cases the solutions of lower budget levels are not possible as
the minimum cost solution for the country exceeds these lower budget bounds. As
no solution can be found in these instances, the output is omitted.
